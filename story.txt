Octo, a 17 month old pug, had now ventured into the unknown beaches on the southern islands of hawaii. He had never seen palm trees like these before, let alone palm trees in general. He was from the midwest, and had grown up in a cold climate where palm trees were never seen. This was new and exciting, but also scary. He had no idea where the rest of his family was, but for now that wasn't what he was worried about. He was hungry and...Oh, Look! SQUIRREL!
Octo chased the squirrel down the beach for what felt like forever. Finally Octo gave up, but then he realized that he was completely lost.
He looked around and tried to find a way back to the place he landed. It was getting darker and darker and he just could not figure out where he was.
